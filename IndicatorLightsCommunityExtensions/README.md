# IndicatorLightsCommunityExtensions
Community-provided patches for IndicatorLights (e.g. mod compatibility).


## What it does

Updates IndicatorLights for compatibility with third-party mods that either add new parts or modify existing stock ones.

Note: These are community-supplied patches. In most cases, the IndicatorLights author (Snark) hasn't personally verified that they work. Each patch includes a comment giving credit to the original author.

## How to install

Unzip the contents of "GameData" to your GameData folder, same as with most mods. (Note, requires that IndicatorLights also be installed in order to work.)
