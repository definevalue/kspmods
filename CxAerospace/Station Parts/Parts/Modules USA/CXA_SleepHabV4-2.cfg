description = |2M Standard Series Habitation Module| Living space contains (4) bunks with associated personal storage lockers. Two points of entry at the ends, and three points of entry at the center, with one hatch oriented for module to be used in a centrifuge. Too bad these are useless since the boys at the factory paneled over the hatches to make it look cleaner on the outside.
