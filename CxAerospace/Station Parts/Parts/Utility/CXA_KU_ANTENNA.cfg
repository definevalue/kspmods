description = This communications antenna has been specifically built for the purpose of downlinking high rate data from space stations. Dish is mounted to an extendable boom to clear adjacent station modules. This antenna also can act as a relay, with automatic store and forward capabilities as well as advanced pathfinding algorithms.
