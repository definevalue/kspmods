description = While the OKTO2 was a very well received item, the venerable OKTO itself was still seeing some use as a cheap way of controlling basic satellites, probes and other unmanned vehicles. This update of that popular model has the full suite of guidance programs, though not much else. It is still fairly cheap though!
