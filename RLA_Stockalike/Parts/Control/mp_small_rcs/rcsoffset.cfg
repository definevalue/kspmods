title = RV-105-45 RCS Thruster Block
manufacturer = STEADLER Engineering Corps
description = Improving the venerable RV-105 seemed like a daunting task, and STEADLER Corps engineers wasted many hours arguing over the best way to do it. One of those options was altering the angle of the nozzles. Designed for 45 degree offset placement to allow for cardinal direction translation. Useful on certain command pods and other components.
